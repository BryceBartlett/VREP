# VREP
A generic pawn based of the enhanced VR plugin

Requires
The Enhanced VR Plugin which has been forked on my account https://github.com/BryceBartlett/VRExpansionPlugin
The Open Input Plugin https://github.com/BryceBartlett/OpenInputPlugin

This pawn uses the UE4 skeletal mesh for both arm and leg IK. I developed this using the Valve Index so SteamVR is used for finger tracking.

Thank you to Joshua (MordenTral) Statzer and the EVR Discord who helped me develop this plugin.
